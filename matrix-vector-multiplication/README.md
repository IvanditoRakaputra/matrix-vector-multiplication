# Matrix and Vector Multiplication Results

The command must be done in the new terminal by typing:

```
wsl 
```
After that, these are the code execution: 

```
- make run;
- make clear;
- make; ./main.out
- make time;
- make space;
```
 
 # Time complexity:
 
To run the time complexity, the code that must executed in the wsl is: 

```
make time
```
This will print out how long did it take for the program to run the time complexity.

Below is the graph about the time complexity displayed from Desmos:

# Space complexity

To run the space complexity, the code that must be executed in the wsl is: 

```
make space
```

The code executed here show you to input the value of N. Here, I use N starting from N = 200. And then, the files are executed 4 more times each with different input values, which the values increase 200 everytime.
